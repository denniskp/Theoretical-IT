    Note:
    Q: What is the gcd of zero and zero?
    A: The definition cannot be used for defining gcd(0, 0), since 0 Ã— n = 0, and zero thus has no greatest divisor.
    However, zero is its own greatest divisor if greatest is understood in the context of the divisibility relation,
    so gcd(0, 0) is commonly defined as 0.
